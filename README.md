# MSTDP

Implementation of the scheme proposed in the "RRAM-Based Spiking Neural Network with Target-Modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity" published on the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems.

It is simple to use, just unzip the included MNIST dataset files and run "main.m". 
The code trains and tests an RRAM-based network on the MNIST dataset.
